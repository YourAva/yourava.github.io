*By [AvaLikesBread](https://github.com/YourAva)*

Heya, and welcome to BitCrunch. Bitcrunch is an article made by yours truly. In my posts I plan to go over a bunch of different techy-programming concepts that I find interesting and have learned to hopefully pass on some of my knowledge to people who are looking to do the same things as me or coming into the tech space.
So, what do I mainly plan to post about and teach?

 - CyberSecurity
 - Malware Development
 - General C/C++ Programming
 - Interesting Projects
 - KiKad Development
 - And much more.

I feel it's necessary to make a disclaimer here. Under no circumstance what I say in these articles may be 100% correct. I *will* try my hardest to make all conveyed information relevant and correct, however I'm by no standards a 'pro' in the industry. If you'd like to correct me on something in my article, or try and talk to the rest of the community, I highly recommend you join [my discord](https://discord.gg/jzMxbK3pv4). *keep in mind this discord isn't made for just this article, it's also to host my YouTube community and any community from almost anything I do.*

Also, a final disclaimer. The template that this GitHub Pages article is under was not made by me, I only configured it. If you wish to use the same template, I highly suggest you follow [the same article I did](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).

Thank you very much for reading my first blog post, Happy Hacking!
